# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition from Scratch (NN + Web)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **handwritten digit recognition system from scratch**, without using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The system includes:
- A fully **self-implemented Neural Network** (NumPy only)
- **Backpropagation + Mini-batch Gradient Descent**
- **Computer Vision preprocessing** to match MNIST format
- A **Flask backend API**
- An interactive **web drawing interface (HTML + Canvas)**

The trained model achieves **~95% accuracy on MNIST** and correctly predicts handwritten digits drawn by users in real time.

## 🧠 Neural Network Architecture

**Why this architecture?**
- 784 matches MNIST input size
- Gradual reduction (128 → 64) helps feature abstraction
- Lightweight but powerful enough to reach high accuracy
- Suitable for training from scratch without GPU
